# TradingDashboard
Forex Trading Dashboard coded in QT and C++. Useful if you want to study the correlation between currency pairs and back test trading strategies.
It's pre-loaded with all the price action data for 2023 and allows you to trade with realistic brokerage fees. However it does not include slippage which might be a good idea for the next version. C++ is a particularly good language for execution. Graphically QML might be nicer for the front end.
